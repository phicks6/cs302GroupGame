Meeting times and decisions made

March 14, 2019 6PM to 8PM
All members were present
We decided that:
Zachary will mainly handle UI elements
Carter will mainly program the environments and areas that the players will navigate through
Philip will work on networking/ multiplayer
Jonny will work on Game logic including player to player interactions and player to object interactions.

We decided that sprites were an element for later in the project and should not be worried about until closer to the deadline

We also understood that most of our time at this point would be spent on tutorials.

We decided that:

We will continue dividing the project in the same way that we already had. Our project is still a skeleton and needs
more work, but now that we have a lot of the tutorials done, we should be able to get more work done on the project.

All members were present
We decided that:

We are struggling with the multiplayer elements at this point. We decided that a better plan would be to shelve that part of the project
and begin working on a modified way where we would use two displays to project the hider and seeker on different screens.
It is similar to split screen, except two different monitors will be used.
