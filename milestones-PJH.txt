1. Link together Unity Colaboration: 5 points (120 mins)
2. Refactor my existing code to work with Unity Colaboration: 5 points (60 mins)
3. Make basic character that can move: 10 points (90 mins)
4. Add multiplayer so there can be more than one basic character moving at once: 25 points (90 mins)
I have a basic character that can move and two computers can connect to the same client but networking is still unfinished and will need to finished in the next sprint. Linking together with Unity Colaborations took move time then we thought, but it does make working together really easy. We've managed to split up the game into roughly 4 tasks for the 4 people and I have taken the networking job. I want to try and front load some hours because the limitations of unity's networking could affect other people's work.
